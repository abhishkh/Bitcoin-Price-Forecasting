#Background
Bitcoin's price is known for being highly volatile, which presents both risks and opportunities for investors, analysts, and traders. With the increasing popularity of cryptocurrencies, predicting Bitcoin's price movements is crucial for better risk management and investment strategies. By analyzing a large dataset of over three million Bitcoin price records from 2017 to 2023, we can use advanced machine learning algorithms to identify trends and patterns that traditional analysis might miss.

This data-driven approach provides deeper insights into market dynamics, helping create predictive models that can alert us to potential price swings. By examining details like open, high, low, and close prices, along with trading volumes and timestamps, we can uncover factors that influence market behavior. This can lead to more informed strategies, reducing the risks associated with Bitcoin's price fluctuations and making it easier to capitalize on market trends.

#Motivation
The main goal of analyzing the Bitcoin price dataset is to develop a model that can accurately predict Bitcoin's price changes. By understanding the historical price data, this model aims to forecast market trends, helping investors make better decisions. Accurate predictions can minimize risks and maximize returns by improving market timing. Additionally, such a model can enhance market efficiency, contribute to academic research on cryptocurrency behavior, and inform regulatory decisions for a more stable financial environment in the digital age.

#Goals
Develop a Predictive Model: Create a model that can accurately forecast Bitcoin's price movements by analyzing historical data from 2017 to 2023.
Data Processing and Cleaning: Ensure the dataset is clean and accurate by handling anomalies, missing values, and outliers.
Apply Machine Learning Algorithms: Use various statistical methods and machine learning algorithms to capture the dynamics of Bitcoin's price fluctuations and evaluate their effectiveness.
Identify Key Factors: Determine the key factors that impact Bitcoin's price and incorporate them into the model to improve prediction accuracy.
Provide Insights and Recommendations: Offer actionable insights and strategic recommendations based on the modelâ€™s findings to support informed decision-making in the cryptocurrency market.
#Methodology
Understanding the Dataset:

Acquire, clean, and preprocess the data by filling in missing values, removing outliers, scaling features, and engineering new features.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Examine the dataset, highlighting key features like timestamps, open, high, low, close prices, and trading volume.
Identify missing values or outliers and explore patterns in price movements.
Investigate periods of high volatility and potential correlations with market or global events.
Examine long-term trends and the relationship between trading volume and price changes.
#Feature Engineering:

Create temporal features such as year, month, day, weekday, and hour to capture patterns and improve model accuracy.
Metrics Used
For the regression model, the following metrics were considered:

Accuracy
Precision
Recall
F1 Score
Confusion Matrix
#Machine Learning Models
The following machine learning models were used:

Linear Regression
XGBoost Regression
Decision Tree Classifier
Random Forest Classifier
Comparison of RMSE Across Different Machine Learning Models
Lower RMSE indicates better prediction accuracy.
Linear Regression performed best with an RMSE of 12.91.
Random Forest followed with an RMSE of 15.58.
XGBoost had a high RMSE of 123.07, possibly due to suboptimal tuning.
Decision Tree had the highest RMSE at 490.28, possibly due to overfitting the training data.
In this case, Linear Regression and Random Forest were the most accurate models.
